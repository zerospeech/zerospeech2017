# $Header: /u/drspeech/repos/quicknet2/NEWS,v 1.114 2011/05/24 01:31:39 davidj Exp $

======================
=== QuickNet v3_31 ===
======================
New features:
 - The 'use_fe' argument is now set to 'false' by default.  It also
   gives a warning if enabled in conjuction with 'use_cuda=true'.
   Note that this will change numerical results in runs where this
   argument is not explicitly set (and probably for the better!) but
   it may slow down some runs on non-CUDA hardware.
 - Improved CUDA forward pass and training performance.  Maybe 30%
   increase in performance for bigger nets, possibly more on smaller nets.
 - Tidied up system status messages in log, including addition of
   CPU speed/type/number of cores.
 - Added support for Intel Math Kernel Library using build option
   --with-blas=imkl
Minor changes:
 - Fixed a build issue with gcc 4.4.3 on Ubuntu.
 - Added new QN_math_init() function.
 - Fixed a typo in the configure usage message.
 - More logging and error checking for CUDA.
Bug fixes:
 - Previously, using large layer sizes with large bunch sizes could
   overflow some system variables when running on CUDA.  Specifically,
   if max_layer_size * bunch_size > 65535*256 then data could be
   corrupted in a random fashion.  This has not been fixed yet but
   checks have been put in to test for this potential overflow and
   trigger an error if the bunch size is too big.  The fix is to reduce the
   bunch size as suggested by the error message.

======================
=== QuickNet v3_30 ===
======================
New features
 - Added CUDA support - performance up to 25GCUPS with large nets on Tesla
    - --with-cuda build option
    - use_cuda command line flag
    - QN_MLP_BunchCudaVar MLP class
    - CUDA hardware reporting in log
    - support for CUDA version in perfsuite and testdata scripts
Minor changes:
 - Machine wordsize now printed in logs.
 - Updated to work with recent versions of AMD's ACML blas library.
 - Added sphinx.txt describing sphinx file format.
 - Added hardware.txt, describing some performance-related hardware
   notes.
 - Some work on MLP3_perf to bring it up to date.
Bug fixes:
 - "Large PFiles:" log entry now correctly says "enabled" on 64 bit OSs

======================
=== QuickNet v3_21 ===
======================
Minor changes:
 - Requires more recent version of autoconf
 - Added matlab_weights (5) man page.
 - Fixed some build and configure time issues, especially related to having
   a different top_builddir.
 - Minor type fixes to work with recent version of gcc (from dpwe)
 - Test suite builds on systems without expf again.
 - Fixed declaration error in QN_fir.h which broke builds on some versions
   of gcc. 
 - Fixed so atlas_buildinfo.h only used with versions of Atlas that have it.
 - Fixed build problems with more recent versions of ATL_buildinfo.h
 - Fixed so large pfiles status reporting works on 64 bit machines.
 - Minor man page fixes.
 - INSTALL-icsi included in the install, which details how ICSI installs
   QuickNet.
 - README-hacker now less out of date.

======================
=== QuickNet v3_20 ===
======================
Bug fixes:
 - Fixed the fast exponent code to handle issues with large and small inputs.
   This could generate NaNs on large nets, ill conditioned training data or
   >3 layers (or some combination thereof).  As a result of this change,
   CUPS performance may be reduced slightly.
 - Fixes in QN_fir.cc for delta calculation - buggy qn_pp_convol_vfvf_vf
   disabled, buggy version of fir code disabled and memory allocation
   bug fixed.
 - Fixed QN_OutFtrLabStream_Ascii to use %g for output by default, with %f as
   a constructor-time option.  Fixes loss of precision.
 - Fixed a problem with error exits causing segfaults in test programs.
 - Fixed issues with spurious characters on the end of file names in logging
   output (QN_FILE2NAME at the source level)
 - Actual program name now printed after argument dump, rather than "progname"!
 - Fixed MLPWeightFile_RAP3 so it has a sensible output routine and doesn't
   break with NaNs.
 - Fixed a possible lower-order bits noise problem in the pp_
   optimized exp() function. 
 - Added a warning when the random buffer cache is bigger than available
   memory, potentially fixing a segfault.
 - QN_SRIfeat.h now included in QuickNet.h
 - Fixed a non-trivial bug in writing SRI features. 
   QN_OutFtrStream_SRI::write_ftrs(cnt, ftrs) wrote repeated data if cnt>1.
   Note that in feacat and feacalc cnt==1 at all times and this object is
   not used by the qn* programs so this didn't exhibit
   itself in any of the centrally-maintained QuickNet-based executables!

Major changes:
 - new programs qnmultifwd/qnmultitrn.  Differences from qnstrn/qnsfwd are:
    - 2->5 layer MLPs supported.
    - matlab weights file format supported and set as default, with rap3
      optionally available.
    - various old, unused command line arguments removed.
    - mlp specification args reworked.
    - only range-based fwd/train/cv sentence selection.
    - no unary_enumerate for forward pass.
    - several argument defaults changed
    - mlp_blas/mlp_pp -> use_blas/use_pp
    - new mlp_lrmultiplier argument to qnmultitrn
    - support tanh output units
    - new arg use_fe to disable fast exponent approximation for 
      sigmoid, softmax and tanh. use_pp can still be used to disable
      other optimized routines
 - qnsfwd (and qnmultifwd) now support "ascii" and "onlftr" as activation
   formats. "onlftr" allows simple piping into feacat.
 - ckpt_weight_file and ckpt_hours added to qnmultitrn and qnstrn to facilitate
   periodic weight file checkpointing (also ckpt_weight_format in qnmulititrn)
 - qncopywts now works, but does not do anything too exciting yet, other
   than trivial conversions.
 - "matlab" is now a weight file format (class QN_MLPWeightFile_Matlab)
 - Most weightfile-related classes and utility functions now handle 2->5
   layer MLPs. 
 - New classes QN_MLP_BunchFlVar and QN_MLP_ThreadFlVar that do a 2->5 layer
   MLPs. These are used by qnmultifwd and qnmultitrn for unthreaded/threaded
   trainings, replacing QN_MLP_BunchFl3 and QN_MLP_ThreadFl3.
 - Support for SRI sparse feature files in library.
Minor changes:
 - '%h' (hostname) and '%t' (time) now available in log and ckpt weight
   file names
 - New vector functions:
     qn_ltoh_vd_vod
     qn_htol_vd_vd
     qn_ltoh_vf_vf
     qn_htol_vf_vf
     qn_copy_z_vz
     qn_copy_vz_vz
     qn_tanh_f_f
     qn_tanh_vf_vf
     qn_dtanh_vf_vf
 - New matlab matrix read/write functions
     QN_Mat_read
     QN_Mat_write
 - Fixed MLPWeightFile interface so get_weightmaj takes no arguments.
 - HardSentTrainer and SoftSentTrainer now support weightfile types.
 - qnxor no longer installed by default.
 - Fixed build problem of variable-length local arrays in threaded net.
 - Fixed library name in sunperf build version.
 - Various changes to MLP initializations to make bugs more apparent
   (NULLs for pointers, NaNs for values)
 - QN_MLP_BunchFl3, QN_MLP_ThreadFl3, QN_MLP_BunchFlVar,
   QN_MLP_ThreadFlVar optimized for 0.0 learning rates.
 - QN_MLP_BunchFlVar, QN_MLP_ThreadFl3 and QN_MLP_ThreadFlVar now all use
   a common base class.
 - Extensions to QN_open and improvements to .gz handling, setvbuf stuff
   and how QN_build_ftrstream works.
 - Programs now display MLP object name.
 - "--with-blas=acml" superceded by "--with-blas=acml-gcc" and
   "--with-blas=acml-psc" 
 - Fixed some problems that made testsuite fail on 64 bit machines.
 - New type of math routing optimiztion "FE", encompasing scalar and vector
   routines based on fast, approximate, exponent code.


======================
=== QuickNet v3_11 ===
======================
Major Changes:
 - Supports more blas libraries
    - blas without cblas
    - essl and esslsmp
    - sunperf
    - acml
 - Incompatible changes to MLPW format to remove fixed point (possible
   'cos MLPW was never used).  Not suitable for use yet.
Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a problem with training when the number of cached frames between
   approx 4x10^6 and 8x10^6.  Net would fail to train with these cache
   sizes.
 - Fixed obvious bug in qndo.sh.
 - Fixed typo in QN_PFile.h that only appeared on machines without fseeko().
 - Fixed pkgconfig files so they reference BLAS libraries
Minor stuff:
 - Fixed some name space pollution in QN_utils.{cc,h} by renaming routines.
 - Fixed some error messages to use file names using QN_File2Name class.
 - Added iconfigure.sh script with example configure command lines.
 - Add back the perfsuite subdir and got it working.
 - Documentation installed into version-numbered directory.
 - Lots of changes to MLP3_perf
 - Now use libtool to build static libraries too.
 - Fixed some QN_fltvec prototypes and compile warnings.
 - New library routine QN_output_sysinfo(), used by qnsfwd and qnstrn.
 - Some minor vector routine optimizations. 
 - Misc portability updates.

======================
=== QuickNet v3_10 ===
======================
Major changes:
 - Added threaded MLP object and mlp3_threads argument.  Implementation uses
   native Posix Threads, hence precluding the need to use a threaded
   BLAS library.
 - Added "--with-blas=macos" to use the MacOS X native version of blas.
   Feedback on the performance of this is welcomed.
Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a bug that prevented files >~16GB from being opened.
 - Fixed a minor bounds error in the QN_open() routine that trip valgrind.
Minor stuff:
 - New "qndo.sh" script for doing architecture-specific executable selection
 - Details of atlas library included in the log output for qnstrn and qnsfwd
 - The weight log file now includes the process number, which can overcome
   problems when two qnstrn processes are running in the same directory and
   overwrite their own log files.
 - Some minor performance improvements in the included matrix/vector library.
 - Added better usage info for mlp3_output_type arg.
 - Fixed some minor linux build issues.
 - Configure options --with-blas=icsi and --with-blas=pticsi no longer
   supported.
 - Added perf.txt, which includes some benchmarking results.

======================
=== QuickNet v3_03 ===
======================
Major changes
 - Added support for 64 bit PFiles.  Note that the number of frames
   must still be <2^31-1.  Check the qnstrn/qnsfwd log output for
   "Large PFiles: enabled" to see if this is supported with any given
   executable.
 - Added a BSD-ish licence.

Bug fixes:
 - --with-blas=ptatlas didn't work.  It should now!
 - fixed qn_mulsum_vfvf_f so it returns a value (not actually used in quicknet)
 - Fixed the value of num_labs() for LNA8 streams.

Minor stuff:
 - added quicknet3-install.pc and modified quicknet3.pc so it should allow
   linking from the source directory as well as linking when installed
   in the libdir/includedir directory.
 - The testsuite has been updated to work for quicknet3, including the
   removal of fltvec dependencies.
 - Addition of configure-time selection of quicknet_testdata directory, 
   --with-testdata=<dir>.  Defaults to $(prefix)/share/quicknet_testdata/
   rather than ../quicknet_testdata.
 - Addition of configure-time selection of rtst location,
   --with-rtst=<dir>.  Defaults to $(exec_prefix)/lib, where rtst v0_26
   and later puts the needed rtst.pc file.  I.e. you need to upgrade
   rtst to use it.
 - Fixed build problems associated with gethostname function.
 - Fixed some warnings for -Wall.

======================
=== QuickNet v3_02 ===
======================
Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a non-trivial bug in QN_OutFtr_stream_SRI.  The problem was that
   writing multiple feature frames in one call to write_ftrs on
   little-endian machines would write garbage.  This would have been
   a major issue were it not for the fact that both feacalc and feacat 
   appear to write data one frame at a time.  Also added some logging
   and fixed an unchecked return code in the process.
 - Fixed configure bugs for --with-blas=cblas and --with-blas=atlas
 - Removed configure reference to perfsuite.
Minor stuff:
 - Fixed some minor warnings as reported by Olivier.
 - Fixed frame number issues in QN_InFtrStream_List and QN_InFtrStream_ListSRI.
 - Fixed a possible bad return value in QN_InFtrStream_Raw::get_pos()
 - Renamed urand48_ff_vf to qn_urand48_ff_vf.
 - Renamed findexp_f_i to qn_findexp_f_i
 - Minor documentation updates.
 - Added "COPYING" file.

======================
=== QuickNet v3_01a ===
======================

Minor stuff:
 - Fixed pkgconfig file.
 - Fixed typos in doc.

======================
=== QuickNet v3_01 ===
======================

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a major back propagation bug in v3_00.  v3_00 should not be used!

Major changes:
 - Added the "hardtarget_lastlab_reject" argument to both qnstrn and qnsfwd.
   If hardtarget_lastlab_reject is set to true then an extra
   label value is allowed that means "do not train on this frame".
   This prevents the features from being presented to the net and also
   means the frame will be ignored when calculating frame-level
   accuracy on forward passes.  A similar feature is implement in
   recent versions of QuickNet v0_99 but without command-line control and
   status reporting.
 - Added library support for SRI "featurefiles" to complement the SRI
   "cepfiles" support that's already included (based on a patch from
   Andreas Stolcke)

Minor stuff:
 - Fixed an install problem with man3 pages on machines with older shells.
 - Fixed some build problems related to errno.h
 - Better documentation on the testdata_* scripts in INSTALL
 - quicknet3.pc package config file created and installed

======================
=== QuickNet v3_00 ===
======================


QuickNet version v3_00 is the first release of the new QuickNet
version 3.  Version v3_00 is based upon QuickNet v0_98 but with
numerous changes.  None of the v0_99 changes were included in this
train directly, i.e. v0_99 has effectively become a branch and the
v0_98->v3_00 version chain is now the mainstream.

Changes from /u/drspeech/src/ version v0_98 to this version include:

 - Some files have gained a "3" suffix.
 - The intvec and fltvec libraries are no longer needed to build
   QuickNet.  All of the necessary routines have been incorporated into
   QuickNet.
 - Support for fixed point nets, SPERT and multi-SPERT has been
   removed, as has any dependencies on fxlib.
 - QuickNet now has "nv" (naive) and "pp" (portable performance)
   versions of many key vector/matrix library routines.  Specifically
   pp versions of the main matrix and non-linearity functions have
   been included.  The pp versions can be considerably faster than the
   naive routines.  The  decision on which version to use is
   controlled from the command line.
 - Incorporation of v0_99's optimized sigmoid/softmax routines.
 - Addition of support for BLAS bunch-mode routines at the
   vector/matrix library level.
   (c.f. v0_99, where it's a switch at the MLP level rather than the
   vector/matrix routine level).  BLAS routine use can be controlled
   at configure time and run time.
 - mlp3_bunch_size now defaults to 16, i.e. bunch-mode is the default
   training mode.
 - qnsfwd now respects the value of mlp3_bunch_size.
 - The maximum number of feature streams that can be opened has been 
   increased from 16 to 1024
 - qnforward and qntrain have been completely removed from the distribution.
 - libtool shared library generation has been included, replacing some
   of the SPRACHcore shared library functionality.  
 - Several configuration changes, including:
    o use of more recent autoconf
    o support for building shared and non-shared libraries in parallel
    o various blas library configure options
    o SPRACHcore stuff is broken
    o removal of RCS commands from the Makefile
 - Libary header files are now installed in a separate subdir
 - The QNConfig.sh file has been renamed QN3Config.sh, the contents
   have changed slightly and no longer include the SHLIB stuff
 - The code in the perfsuite directory no longer depends on rprf.
 - There may be some issues with testsuite, specifically finding the rtst
   library and some checks that fail
 - The doc files are now put in a separate subdir
 - Several minor fixes to e.g. man pages

Note that "QuickNet v3_xx" is a seperate CVS tree from the later v0_xx
releases, specifically v0_99.  The module name is "quicknet2"
(c.f. "quicknet" for v0_99 and below) and the CVS archive was built
from the original RCS files rather than imported text files.  In
"quicknet2" it's possible to see an extended history but missing the
v0_99 branch.



    ======================
    === QuickNet v?_?? ===
    ======================

    As of May 2004, there are multiple versions of QuickNet installed
    in personal and shared directories at ICSI, including several
    based on v0_99 which may well have the same version number.  These are not
    necessarily of release quality.  Also the CVS version is still
    called v0_99 but has had some changes added that don't appear in
    installed versions.
    Some of these may or may not include:
     - support for sub-epochs (a.k.a. interim weight files)
     - support for multiple "unary_file"-like inputs (a.k.a. code books)
     - a fix so that bunch mode bunch size works for forward passes.

    ======================
    === QuickNet v2_01 ===
    ======================
    *** Not documented at time of release - added later by David Johnson ***

    Something called QuickNet 2_01 appeared in the drspeech tree in
    October 2002.  Little is known about this.

    ======================
    === QuickNet v0_99 ===
    ======================
    *** Not documented at time of release - added later by David Johnson ***

    QuickNet v0_99 was released in September 2002 by Chris Oei.  Before
    the release, the code from the original RCS files in
    ICSI:/u/drspeech/src/quicknet/ was imported as an initial revision into a
    new CVS repository.  Chris added the following features:

     - use of "tao_of_icsi.sh" to set paths (only works at ICSI)
     - fast bunch-mode operation using externally-supplied blas libraries
       with command-line enabling (but not documented in man pages!)
     - optimized vector routines with approximations for softmax and sigmoid
     - inclusion of "reject" label in hard target training
     - addition of profiling code to main quicknet routines
     - % of CV time displayed

    It is possible that multiple versions of QuickNet v0_99 were installed at
    ICSI.

=============================
=== QuickNet v0_98/v0_98a ===
=============================
*** Not documented at time of release - added later by David Johnson ***
*** Some intermediate releases may have been missed ***

QuickNet version v0_98 and v0_98a were released sometime in July 2000 by Dan
Ellis.  There were more significant additions of functionality:

 - support for sentence range selection added to command line
 - support for multiple types of normalization (per utterance, per file,
   online) and command line control of normalization constants
 - addition of Ranges to library

It is possible that other versions of v0_98a were installed at ICSI, maybe
with some command-line support for SRI format feature files that was
added by Chuck Wooters.

=======================
=== QuickNet v0_97a ===
=======================

*** Not documented at time of release - added later by David Johnson ***
*** Note no records of v0_97 can be found in logs, only info on v0_97a ***
*** Some intermediate releases may have been missed ***

QuickNet version v0_97a was released sometime in October 1999 by Dan
Ellis.  The were a lot of additions, some of which no doubt I am
unaware of.  Some big changes from v0_96 include:

 - multispert support added
 - support for bunch-mode fixed-point nets with 32 bit weights added
 - addition of online delta calculation
 - support for lists of float arguments added, including use for biases
 - ILab label file format added to library and qns* programs
 - lna and onlftr file format added to qnstrn
 - bunch size added to qnsfwd
 - some additions to learning rate controls
 - shared library support for SPRACHcore
 - support for feature file pasting added
 - support for ASCII streams added to library
 - support for HTK streams added to library
 - support for fir filters added to library

======================
=== QuickNet v0_96 ===
======================

The main justification for releasing v0_96 is to provide a stable
released version of quicknet for everyone currently using
prereleases. There are only minor differences between v0_96 and
v0_95i.

QuickNet v0_96 needs fltvec-v0_05, fxlib-v0_03 and intvec-v0_04.
However, as-yet-unreleased versions of the libraries will be needed to
use quicknet in an integrated package like SPRACHworks.

It also needs quicknet_testdata-v0_06 and rtst-v0_24 if you want to
run the library test programs.

Changes include:

programs:
 - renamed swbtrain and swbforward to qnstrn and qnsfwd (think of the
   "s" as meaning stream)
 - added new options "ftr1_format", "ftr1_width", "ftr2_format", "ftr2_width"
   to qnsfwd and qnstrn, with "pre" format added in both programs
   and "onlftr" added in qnsfwd.
 - added new option "hardtarget_format" in qnstrn, with "pre" format
   support added
 - improved status reporting - errors & warnings now appear in log
   files in all programs
 - qnsfwd can now direct status messages to standard error
 - increased range for 32-bit fixed-point weights
 - new options "realtime" & "realtime-latency" in qnsfwd for improved
   interactive response
 - new options "softtarget_file", "softtarget_format",
   "softtarget_width" & "softtarget_window_offset" in qnstrn to
   facilitate training with soft targets

libraries:
 - some old, unused classes (basically all those without the "QN"
   suffix) have been removed

testsuite:
 - some tests for qnsfwd have been added to the testsuite, but the
   corresponding data files are not yet in the testdata distribution

perfsuite:

distribution/scripts/documentation:
 - the mechanism used to access libraries, eg fltvec, has been
   improved. This allows for the combining of quicknet with libraries to
   form packages a la SPRACHworks
 - man pages updated appropriately

======================
=== QuickNet v0_95 ===
======================

The main justification for releasing v0_95 is improvements in
training, specifically better performance in fixed point trainings
(using 32 bit weights) and a bug fix in floating-point bunch-mode
training.

QuickNet v0_95 needs fltvec-v0_05, fxlib-v0_03 and intvec-v0_04.  It
also needs quicknet_testdata-v0_06 and rtst-v0_24 if you want to run
the library test programs.

Changes include:

programs:
 - qntrain now uses 32 bit weights with a weight exponent of 2
 - swbtrain now has "mlp3_weight_bits" option to switch between 16 bit and
   32 bit weights
 - fixed bunch mode training bug in qntrain and swbtrain (as previously
   released patch)
 - default weight exponents now 2 in qnforward and swbforward
 - qnxor now uses 32 bit weights

libraries:
 - new clas "QN_MLP_Online1632Fx3" - fixed point MLP with weights accumulated
   in 32 bits but used as 16 bits

testsuite:
 - added tests for "QN_MLP_Online1632Fx3"

perfsuite:
 - updated MLP3_perf to support bunch mode and 32 bit weight nets

distribution/scirpts/documentation:
 - fixed broken example scripts (later arguments were ignored due to # chars)
 - sorted out "configure.in"/"Makefile.in" to allow better overriding of eg.
   LIBS and CFLAGS
 - documented how to add to library/include paths in INSTALL
 - removed some lies fro README-hacker

======================
=== QuickNet v0_94 ===
======================

There are two changes of importance in this release - some
improvements in fixed-point performance and the addition of
floating-point bunch-mode training.  ["bunch mode" is the term
used to describe a method of training whereby multiple frames of data
are passed forward through the MLP before errors are back propagated
and weights updated.  This often allows faster training when used with
optimized matrix operations such as those in fltvec.]  There are also
several other minor improvements and bug fixes.

QuickNet v0_94 needs fltvec-v0_05 and intvec-v0_03.  It also needs
quicknet_testdata-v0_06 and rtst-v0_19 if you want to run the library test
programs.

Changes include:

programs:
 - new "mlp3_bunch_size" option in swbtrain
 - new "bunch_size" option in qntrain
 - better fixed point performance in qntrain and swbtrain
 - default hid2out_exp value now 1 in swbtrain
 - fixed spurious error message in swbforward when working with no
   hardtarget file
 - swbforward and qnforward should now both produce good "rapbin" format
   output on little-endian machines - no known endian-dependent code
   remains
 - fixed a bug that could potentially result in one extra frame in the
   first sentence of an LNA file

libraries:
 - new files "QN_mat.{cc,h}" - preliminary version of Matlab format
   output routines
 - new class "QN_MLP_OnlineFl3Diag" - as yet unfinished MLP class with
   internal value logging
 - "QN_OutFtrStream_Rapact.{cc,h}" renamed "QN_RapAct.{cc.h}".
 - "QN_MLP_BunchFl3" now completed.
 - Half-finished implementation of QN_InFtrStream_Rapact - a class for
   reading RAP activation files.

distribution:
 - added new options to test scripts

testsuite:
 - Added "mat_test.cc" - currently just tests Matlab output routines


======================
=== QuickNet v0_93 ===
======================

The main change in this release is the enhancement of "swbforward".
Specifically, forward passes with unary (i.e. one-of-n) inputs are now
supported, as well as forward passes which hypotheses of all previous
states.

QuickNet v0_93 needs fltvec-v0_05 and intvec-v0_03.  It also needs
quicknet_testdata-v0_06 and rtst-v0_19 if you want to run the library test
programs.

Changes include:

programs:
 - swbforward now has working "unary_file" option
 - swbforward now has "unary_enumerate" option for hypothesizing all
   values of unary input (for "previous state" forward pass)
 - swbforward and qnforward support "lna8" (8 bit LNA files with
   scaling factors as used at Cambridge) as an activation file format
   (note that this is so slow on SPERT as to be unusable - to be fixed
   in a future release of the fixed point libraries!)
 - swbforward can now work without a hardtarget file
 - swbforward supports "pfile" as a valid activation file format
   (don't ask why!!)
 - swbtrain reports best training accuracy as well as best CV accuracy
 - new "log_file" argument for swbforward
 - fixed a bug in swbforward logging
 - programs now give warnings when using fixed point on workstation or
   floating point on SPERT

libraries:
 - fixed a couple of minor bugs in pfile I/O routines
 - removed old debugging code from QN_MLP_OnlineFx3
 - new class "QN_OutFtrStream_LNA8" in "QN_camfiles.{cc,h}"

distribution:
 - new scripts "testdata_swbtrain_ps.sh" and
   "testdata_swbforward_ps.sh" for testing use of unary inputs for
   "previous state" training

testsuite:
 - Added "LNA8_test2" test for "QN_OutFtrStream_LNA8"

======================
=== QuickNet v0_92 ===
======================

This release contains a new training program, "swbtrain", and a new
forward pass program "swbforward".  These new programs are pretty much
a superset of "qntrain" and "qnforward", although some minor options
(specifically some file formats) are not included in the new program
yet.  It is intended that these new programs will eventually replace
"qntrain" and "qnforward" (maybe in version v1_00).

New features in swbtrain and swbforward (on top of qntrain/qnforward
v0_91 functionality) include:
 - support for two feature files with separate windowing on each file
 - support for separate target label files
 - a new method for specifying windowing options
 - new, more logical, option names
 - separate seed options for each type of random operation
 - better specification of fixed point exponents 
 - support for "unary" input files (which can be used for "previous
   state trainings"

Check out the man pages for more details.

Other changes include:

programs:
 - Better warnings on many fixed point errors
 - Changed some exponents so less chance of fatal saturation with
   large fixed point nets
 - Improved misc. error messages
 - Yet more checks for broken PFiles
 - Argument printing routine now includes "\" at end of lines - now
   much easier to copy arguments with mouse

libraries:
 - New class "QN_InFtrStream_JoinFtrs" for merging two feature streams
 - New class "QN_InFtrStream_OneHot" for converting a label stream
   into a feature stream
 - Support for strided versions of "read_ftrs()" and "read_labs()" in
   input stream classes
 - Separation of input2hidden and hidden2output weight exponents in
   QN_MLP_OnlineFx3.
 - Now compiles with SPARCCompiler 4.0 C/C++ (but still need "LD=CC"
   on the make command line)

testsuite:
 - Test for "QN_InFtrStream_OneHot"

distribution:
 - Addition of swbtrain and swbforward, along with man pages and
   example scripts
 - Slight change in the way version numbering works
 - New file "newargs.txt" containing details of command line arguments

======================
=== QuickNet v0_91 ===
======================

This release is to fix a subtle and unpleasant bug.  All the recent
versions (from before v0_12) of "qnforward" have used _softmax_
non-linearities on the output layer of the MLP.  Unfortunately,
"qntrain" had been hard coded to perform training and cross validation
using nets with _sigmoid_ units (and relative entropy error criteria).
This has been fixed in v0_91 by making the output layer nonlinearity
user-selectable.

Note that the bug doesn't seem to have had any significant effect on
frame level error rates (which is why it went unnoticed!).  There is a
possibility of some effect on word level error rates - this is being
investigated and I'll let people know any effects when we have
completed our experiments.

programs:
 - Added mlp_output_type option.

libraries:
 - Fixed a couple of compilation problems.

======================
=== QuickNet v0_90 ===
======================

This release includes the completely restructured feature and label
file handling functionality.  The net effect is to support multiple
streams of training data in a flexible way, including supporting
different windowing on each stream. Note that most of the changes are
only in the library - the actual programs (qntrain,qnforward) haven't
been changed to use the new features yet.

QuickNet v0_90 needs fltvec-v0_04, intvec-v0_03.  It also needs
quicknet_testdata-v0_05 rtst-v0_19 if you want to run the library test
programs.

programs:
 - Despite massive internal reorganization, programs are fundamentally
   unchanged.
 - "qntrain" now needs the training cache size specified in frames,
   rather than sentences.  Choosing a value for this is now much less
   hit and miss.
 - "qntrain" now outputs status information on each cache fill.
 - New "list" learning rate schedule type, and new "learnrate" option
   ("initial_learnrate" option is superceded by this).  Default
   learning rate schedule now named "newbob".
 - Higher resolution timers used to calculate performance (e.g. MCUPS),
   relieves accuracy problems caused by quantization.
 - Fixed bug in specifying stdio buffer sizes - should speed things
   up for smaller net sizes.
 - Changed some default values.
 - "qnnorm" sentence selection reinstated.
 - "input_normfile" option changed - a null value now means use no norm
    file.
 - New options "ftrfile_num_ftrs" (qnforward) and
   "train_ftrfile_num_ftrs" (qntrain).  Useful when using headerless
   feature files (e.g. Cambridge "pre" format).  "first_ftr" and
   "num_ftrs" now work correctly with headerless feature files.

libraries:
 - Millions of new classes for handling streams:
   QN_InFtrStream_Norm - normalize a stream
   QN_InFtrStream_Narrow - take a contiguous subset of the features in a stream
   QN_InFtrStream_SplitFtrLab - efficiently split a combined feature
	and label stream into its constituent parts
   QN_In{Ftr,Lab}Stream_Cut - split a stream "vertically"
	into two (possibly overlapping) new streams
   QN_In{Ftr,Lab}Stream_SeqWindow - apply a window to a stream
   QN_In{Ftr,Lab}Stream_RandWindow - randomize and window a stream
	(like the old FrameSentCursor_Cache class
   QN_InLabStream_FrameInfo - return a stream of {epoch,segno,frameno}
	triples - useful for testing
 - "QN_OutFtrLabStream_PFile" now writes indexed PFiles.
 - New streams-based training class - QN_HardSentTrainer
 - New streams-based forward pass function - QN_HardForward
 - New rate schedule class for list of learning rates -
   QN_RateSchedule_List
 - QN_RateSchedule_NewBoB now handles maximum number of epochs
 - New class QN_ClassLogger that can be used to add logging to a class
 - Sequence generators renamed - now QN_SeqGen_RandomNoReplace etc.
 - New time functions - QN_time() and QN_timestr().
 - QN_Arg functions now accept lists of floats as a type.

testsuite:
 - New test programs for new classes.

installation/distribution:
 - Tidied up INSTALL document a little.
 - Should install on Irix5 out of the box.

======================
=== QuickNet v0_50 ===
======================

This release is an intermediate release, including some of the
restructuring that replaces sentence databases ("SentDB"s) with
streams-based interfaces ("InFtrStream"s, "InLabStream"s etc).  For
production use of the actual programs such as "qntrain", v0_12 is
still the preferred version (although people should try the new
versions to make sure I haven't broken anyone's favourite feature).
However, for library users, v0_50 is a better version to use, as it is
closer in form to the approaching QuickNet 1.0.

QuickNet v0_50 needs fltvec-v0_03, intvec-v0_03.  It also needs
quicknet_testdata-v0_05 rtst-v0_19 if you want to run the library test
programs.

programs:
 - "qntrain" and "qnforward" can now read Cambridge "pre" feature files.
   This is not yet fully tested due to lack of suirtable data files.
   Could someone try them and let me know how it goes?
 - All programs used streams-based input, although with some hacks as
   not all the required streams classes are available (hopefully no
   user-visible change).
 - "qnnorm" has now regressed! Now it can only normalize whole
   PFiles, rather than a given range of sentences.  Use "qnnorm-v0_12"!

libraries:
 - New header file "QN_streams.h" with definitions of various stream
   interfaces for input and output (note - these aren't C++ streams,
   but rather QuickNet streams designed to handle sentence data. The
   principle is the same, though!).
 - New stream based classes for reading and writing PFiles -
   "QN_InFtrLabStream_PFile" and "QN_OutFtrLabStream_PFile".
 - New classes for reading LNA files ("QN_InFtrLabStream_LNA8"),
   Cambridge format feature files ("QN_InFtrLabStream_PreFile") and
   ICSI online feature files ("QN_InFtrLabStream_OnlFtr").
 - The old normalization routine ("QN_statdb") has been replaced with 
   a streams-based version ("QN_ftrstats").
 - Many things previously called "sentences" are now called
   "segments" - just trying to keep things general.
 - New QN_LOG constants in QN_Logger.h to be used for specifying
   debugging levels.
 - New routines QN_open() and QN_close() - preferred way of opening
   and closing files.

testsuite:
 - New test programs for new classes.

installation/distribution:
 - "INSTALL" document updated.

======================
=== QuickNet v0_12 ===
======================

library:
 - Fixed some build problems.

testsuite:
 - Fixed so that some tests that were previously not run by default are now
   run
 - Fixed some tests that were breaking

installation/distribution:
 - Updated "INSTALL" with more details on building for SPERT
 - "testdata" scripts now use fixed point by default on SPERT

======================
=== QuickNet v0_11 ===
======================

all programs:
 - New "debug" command line argument.  Setting this to a number
   between 0 and 6 will control the amount of debugging messages issued
 - Some messages changed, error messages and warnings improved
 - Potential bug in selecting weight ranges fixed
 - Now works if all sentences are one frame long

qnforward:
 - New "mlp_weightexp" command line argument for controlling fixed
   point weight exponents.  Useful for forward passes with floating point
   trained weights

library:
 - All modules now use QN_config.h

installation/distribution:
 - This NEWS file now included, and also installed as QuickNet-NEWS.txt
 - New example program for using the net - "qnxor.cc" - included
 - Library now installed

======================
=== QuickNet v0_10 ===
======================

all programs:
 - PFile reading now uses sentence index data - should be much faster
   for forward pass, especially if executions pmaked across networks
 - MCUPS/MCPS ratings slightly more accurate

library:
 - Many warnings during build eliminated
 - New `QN_SentDB*' classes replace old `FrameSentDB' equivalents.
   These use the standard conventions for argument passing, logging
   etc.
 - New `QN_FtrOutStream' base class and derived `QN_FtrOutStream_Rapact' for
   outputting activations, replacing old output functions in
   `QN_utils'.  Paves the way for a variety of output file formats
   (LNA next...).
 - `QN_MLP' classes now have a member function indicating the number
   of connections.

distribution:
 - Now includes `testsuite' subdirectory - check the README-hacker
   file for details (plus a few more details on the `perfsuite' directory).
 - `quicknet_testdata-v0_02' now needed for testsuite

======================
=== QuickNet v0_09 ===
======================

qntrain:

 - Several escape characters added to the `log_weightfile' command line
   argument.  From the man page:

               Three special substrings can be used to in the log
               weightfile  filename. The string %p is replaced by
               the process number of the  qntrain  process.   The
               string %e is replaced by the number of the current
               epoch (allowing weight logs from all epochs to  be
               retained).   The string %% is replaced by a single
               %.
   Note that epoch numbers start from 1, unlike BoB which starts from 0.

 - The `max_epochs' command line argument now works correctly - use a
   value of 1 if you want one epoch!
 - The intial weights are never saved as the "best" weights, even if
   the error increases in subsequent epochs (suggested by John
   Lazzaro).
 - Slight performance increase in training small nets on SPERT.

all:

 - Status logs now line buffered on SPERT.
 - Now prints host name in log file (which also includes
   details of which spert board if appropriate).
 - The libraries and programs can now be built _without_ the fixed
   point library.  Executables built in this fashion will fail with an
   error if the `use_fx=true' command line argument is used.
 - Numerous changes to Makefiles and configure scripts, including
   support for building distributions, better RCS handling, better
   rebuilding of Makefiles etc, more portable.
 - Increased source portability and misc. tidy ups.
 - Inclusion of some basic developer-level documentation (`INSTALL',
   `INSTALL-icsi',`README', `README-hacker').

======================
=== QuickNet v0_08 ===
======================

 - Completed some restructuring that reduced memory usage and tidied up
   the MLP classes.
 - Various tweaks in the fixed point MLP class.  These changes improve
   frame level error by almost 1% on digits - your mileage may vary.
 - A bug in the MLP training class was fixed.  Previously, invalid
   labels in a feature file could cause memory corruption (sorry you
   had to find this one, Jean Marc!).
 - The usage message now includes the version number.
