sndf	- a low-level multi-format soundfile interface library
snd	- a higher-level integrated interface to sndf soundfiles
audIO	- a portable audio hardware input/output interface library

sndplay   - a simple soundfile play program
sndrecord - a simple program for recording soundfiles from audio hardware
sndcmp    - for gathering statistics on a soundfile, or the difference 
	    between two soundfiles.
sndrfmt   - change the format (sample type, number of channels) of a soundfile.
sndrsmp   - change the sampling rate (resample/interpolate) a soundfile.

Each component has its own man page (e.g. sndf.man).
